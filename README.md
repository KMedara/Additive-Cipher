# Additive-Cipher
Symmetric key cipher. Brute-force attack program to break the encrypted message. Cipher text is hard-coded but can easily be made to accept user input. The output will be a list of plaintext in which you can choose one manually that makes sense (i.e. like an English sentence) through which we break the encrypted message successfully.
